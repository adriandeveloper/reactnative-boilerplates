# reactnative-boilerplates

## Some simple React Native boilerplates.

### TODO's 
- Add Redux to projects
- Add some essential packages to get up and running quickly
- Add basic structure of the app
- Write detailed README of what packages are included in this setup.

## Why do this?

Honestly, just for me and my workflow but feel free to use if you just need a vanilla boilerplate setup.
Can you basically get the same initial setup with react-native init or create-react-native-app?  Yeah.

Instead of doing those things though.. for me, I just want to set up a project with my preferred defaults ready to go.

I will be updating these and created new branches of the archived versions. 


Cheers,

Adrian
